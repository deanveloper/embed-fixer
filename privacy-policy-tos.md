The following is the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy for the "embed fixer" discord bot (username: `embed fixer#9232`, uid: `1193667174628327546`).

# Terms of Service

This discord bot is intended to be used in order to improve the embeds of links which are posted in Discord servers. Don't use it for any other purposes.

If you find any security issues, please responsibly disclose them. As previously stated, do not use the bot for purposes outside of improving the embeds of links posted in Discord servers.

# Privacy Policy

* This bot may read message content in order to tell if messages contain fixable links.
* This bot does not permanently save any data.
  * There is some logging to `stdout`, but the server does not persist stdout to any locations outside of a `screen` instance.
* Content of messages are not logged except for special cases (ie, when errors occur).
  * Even in these error cases, logs are not persisted outside of an ephemeral `screen` instance.
* You may notice that this bot uses the `weebsocket` library, which logs all input/output on development builds.
  * The server which hosts the embed fixer bot does *not* use development builds.
* The bot is hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet, so is subject to any disclosures about end-users in the [DigitalOcean Privacy Policy](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/privacy-policy)
